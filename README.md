# STANLEY-A_Self-Concealing_Unmanned_Ground_Vehicle
A Project in collaboration with DRDO Robotics and Unmanned System Exposition.
Some military organizations take the help of UGV in the risk prone areas which are not that effective when done by army men. Stanley is a Self-Concealing UGV that is equipped with modern technology that enables it to conceal itself by various methods in response to a threat from the enemy.
The UGV possesses camouflaging behavior by virtue of which 
Type 1 : 
it changes its colour and adapts itself to the colour of the surroundings, thus deceiving the enemy.
Type 2 :
it changes its temperature according to surrounding hence hide from thermal imaging.
*Type 3 :*
it can aquire desired shape with the help of silicon skin as an octapus do.

The UGV also has high power driven drillers that impart high torque to the system and make drilling easy.
